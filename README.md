# **E-commerce-Retail-B2B Case Study**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of E-commerce and Retail B2B data, focusing on customer behavior, payment trends, and late-payment analysis. The project leverages Python and associated libraries for data cleaning, processing, and visualization.

## **Project Overview**

This case study aims to uncover insights from B2B retail transactions. By exploring the dataset, we address questions related to customer trends, invoice patterns, payment delays, and more. The analysis is divided into multiple stages, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and reporting actionable insights.

## **Files in the Repository**

1. **`E-Commerce & Retail B2B.ipynb`**  
   This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code for:
   - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Payment Delay Categorization
   - Visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts)
   - Statistical Analysis for identifying trends in payment behavior.

2. **`E-commerce & Retail B2B.pdf`**  
   A detailed report summarizing the project's findings, methodologies, and key takeaways. This document provides context to the analysis and highlights the business implications of the results.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, ensured consistent formats, and optimized memory usage.
- **Payment Analysis**: 
  - Categorized payment delays using custom labels such as "No Delay," "2 Weeks," etc.
  - Analyzed the distribution of late payments across various time ranges.
- **Customer Behavior Insights**: Identified patterns in customer payment trends and their correlation with invoice attributes.
- **Visualization**: Leveraged `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to create insightful plots for better understanding of the data.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `datetime` for handling date and time operations
